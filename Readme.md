# Thyroid Disease Detection Using Ensemble Modeling
This project focuses on the detection of thyroid disease using an ensemble of machine learning models. 
Ensemble learning combines multiple models to improve the accuracy and robustness of the predictions, reducing the risk of overfitting and increasing generalization.

## Key Features
- Ensemble Learning: Combines multiple machine learning algorithms to achieve better predictive performance than any individual model.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses thyroid disease data for training.
- Model Selection: Uses a combination of models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Performance Metrics: Evaluates the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Ensemble Models Used
- Random Forest: A tree-based ensemble model that aggregates the predictions from multiple decision trees.
- Gradient Boosting: Builds models sequentially, improving the performance of each new model by focusing on the mistakes of the previous ones.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): A powerful classifier used within the ensemble to maximize predictive power.
